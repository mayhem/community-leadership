# No leader, no project. 

Bottom is not enough. ( http://kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/02/the_bottom_is_n.php )

# Build a core team. 

Identify needed positions, fill them with qualified people. If a person leaves, replace them. Now.

# Delegate. Follow-up. Deliver.

Delegating is important, but doing it without follow-up is pointless.

# Sanity check constantly. Call Bullshit ASAP.

If something is off the rails, speak up now.

# Document everything.

Decisions, plans, schedules. Keep project info online and accessible to all. It does not have to be exhaustive, but it has to be something.

# Have a project timeline.

If you have no idea of time passing, how can you ensure that you'll deliver on time?

# Know your budget.

Even if its a rough budget, how can you tell if your project is feasible? 

# Don't waste people's time.

Hold effective and short meetings. Avoid useless tasks.
